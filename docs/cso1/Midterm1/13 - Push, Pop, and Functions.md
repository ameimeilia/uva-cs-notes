# Push, Pop, and Functions
## icode 5
- `b = 0, 1, 2` can be executed with the `ALU`
- data path is long, make sure clock is slow enough for all data to propagate

</div>

- `b = 3` can be executed by adding `PC` as an input to the mux leading to `WD3`

## icode 6
- `b = 0` can be executed by adding `IM` as an input to the mux leading to `WD3`

- `b = 3` can be executed by adding a mux to the address input of the data memory

- `b = 1, 2` can be executed by adding a mux to the second input of the `ALU`

## Functions
- the location of the function can be hard-coded, but the return location cannot
- the solution is to save `PC = next instruction`, then read and jump back to that location after executing the function
- save `PC + 2` to be accessed by `ret` (return instruction), set `PC = M\[PC + 1\]`

## The Stack
- used for recursive calls
- the stack holds function states and their associated return addresses
- the stack grows to lower addresses â†’ functions are pushed to the bottom of the stack
- `RSP` (register stack pointer) holds the location of the TOP of the stack in memory

## Push and Pop Instructions
**Push**
- decrements the `RSP`
- pushes to the top of the stack

**Pop**
- returns the value at the top of the stack
- increments `RSP`
